Last week I went running for the first time.
Well, not for the first time ever, but for the first time in a really long time.
A time span so long, that it warrants a slightly more sensational title (though 
neither "Going Running for the First Time" nor "Going Running for the First Time 
in a Really Long Time" are particularly sensational and arousing; really, why 
the hell are you reading this?), in my humble opinion.
I think the last time I went for a run&mdash;it was so long ago that I can't
even remember exactly when&mdash;was around the time I had the written exams for 
my *Abitur* (German A-levels).
That was in April or May 2015, so pretty much exactly eight years ago.
Long enough for the bad memories to cease their hunting. 
Long enough to forget the suffering I put myself through.
Long enough to get weary, let down my guard and fall prey to the sweetly
venomous words of ~~Lucifer~~ my obviously masochist friends.
Certainly time has corroded my defenses and opened the door for new painful 
memories to arise.
Which they did.
And now I'm going to tell you about them in a hopefully slightly funny and 
entertaining story that does not contain an ounce of advice or anything else 
you could apply to your life.
I can't help myself, I just find human foolishness endlessly amusing.
Which is probably why God gave me so much of it.
