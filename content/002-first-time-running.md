Last week I went running for the first time.
Well, not for the first time ever, but for the first time in a really long time.
A time span so long that it warrants a slightly more sensational title (though 
neither "Going Running for the First Time" nor "Going Running for the First Time 
in a Really Long Time" are particularly sensational and arousing; really, why 
the hell are you reading this?) in my humble opinion.
I think the last time I went for a run&mdash;it was so long ago that I can't
even remember exactly when&mdash;was around the time I had the written exams for 
my Abitur (German A-levels).
That was in April or May 2015, so pretty much exactly eight years ago.
Long enough for the bad memories to cease their hunting. 
Long enough to forget the suffering I put myself through.
Long enough to get weary, let down my guard and fall prey to the sweetly
venomous words of ~~Lucifer~~ my obviously masochist friends.
Certainly time has corroded my defenses and opened the door for new painful 
memories to arise.
Which they did.
To properly process them I wrote this hopefully slightly funny and entertaining 
story that does not contain an ounce of wisdom, advice or anything else valuable 
that you could apply to your own life.
I just can't help myself but to find human foolishness endlessly amusing.
Which is probably why God gave me so much of it.

You&mdash;probably a responsible adult with working instincts and the healthy 
ability to assess your own skills and abilities with accuracy&mdash;may be 
asking yourself right now: what is he talking about, running isn't so bad?
Running is not bad at all and it can be a very healthy and rewarding endeavour.
After all, our bodies were built to run.
But, as you might have guessed by now, I'm not a responsible adult with working
instincts and the healthy ability to assess my own skills and abilities with 
accuracy.
Like pretty much anything else out there, the act of putting one feet in front
of the other in an interval so rapid that there's a short period of time where 
neither foot touches the ground can be abused and perverted in a way it becomes 
painful and destructive to the organism performing this particular motion.
You see, oftentimes&mdash;especially without past experiences for 
guidance&mdash;I'm overestimating my abilities to a point beyond mere folly, no, 
the results tend to be in the land of utter and complete absurdity.
Combine this with the inability to be reasonable and give up when it becomes
clear that the set goals are not realistic and you'll experience a good 
dosage of self-inflicted physical and mental pain.
This stubbornness allows me to experience these strange moments where I get a 
short but intense glimpse at the true extend of my abilities; never flattering.
Luckily for me I'm weak as hell, so I don't need to run 200 miles in two days 
straight like Courtney Dauwalter (a person I've nothing but admiration for) to
enter my pain cave, but just eight kilometers in about an hour, never far from 
home.
