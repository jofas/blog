+++

This is a tale of human foolishness and does not contain an ounce of wisdom.
A few weeks ago I went running for the first time.
Not for the first time ever, but for the first time in a really long time.
So long that it warrants a slightly more sensational title, though neither 
"Going Running for the First Time" nor "Going Running for the First Time in a 
Really Long Time" are particularly arousing.
I think the last time I went for a run&mdash;it was so long ago that I can't
remember exactly when&mdash;was in the early summer months of 2015, pretty 
much exactly eight years ago.
Long enough for the bad memories to cease their hunting. 
Long enough to forget the suffering.
Long enough to get weary, let down my guard and fall prey to the sweetly
venomous words of ~~Lucifer~~ my obviously masochist friends.
Time has corroded my defenses and opened the door for new painful memories to 
arise.
This is a story about these sweet memories.

A responsible adult with working instincts and the ability to assess 
their own abilities with accuracy may be asking themselves right now: what's 
this all about, running isn't so bad?
I agree (now), running is not bad at all and can be a very healthy and rewarding 
endeavour.
After all, we were born to run \[[1](#ref-1)\].
But like pretty much anything else out there, the act of putting one feet in 
front of the other so rapidly that there's a short moment where neither foot 
touches the ground can be abused until it becomes painful and destructive to 
the organism performing this particular motion.
To pervert something so ordinary, all you need is a morbid wish for 
self-flagellation through physical exercise, a tendency for absurd 
overestimation of your own skills and the inability to give up on unrealistic 
goals.
Perfect recipe for a healing dosage of good ol' self-inflicted physical and 
mental pain.

I make it sound like the first run after my prolonged absence was a marathon,
or some other über-human distance.
Unfortunately it was not.
Turns out I don't need to run 200 miles in two days straight like Courtney 
Dauwalter to enter my pain cave. 
Just eight kilometers in about an hour, never far from home are sufficient.
I can't lie, one of the most uncomfortable ailments afterwards was my hurting
ego.
Before it all, I thought I was in peak physical condition.
I've been doing sports pretty much my whole life, with only two notable 
absences, neither one recent. 
One year when I was fourteen and three years from 2017 to 2020.
The former was due to a knee injury and the latter was caused by pure and utter 
laziness.
Before 2017 I was playing basketball in a club and all other athletic 
training&mdash;including running&mdash;was accessory to my goal of 
becoming a good basketball player. 
A few things happened in my life, one being the development of chronic 
pain in my knees, shins and feet due to my flat footedness and I just stopped 
playing basketball, a sport I have played since I remember.
I tried to do some exercises in the months that followed, but never mustered 
enough motivation to find a training routine suitable to improve my weaknesses.
The next three years I did not exercise regularly, no weightlifting and for 
sure no running.
I lost some weight but otherwise stayed in decent enough shape and didn't
degenerate too badly.

In 2020 then, a friend&mdash;a decent amateur strength athlete&mdash;and 
I were discussing the fact that we were not using the offerings of our 
university enough.
He suggested to go to the gym together, as our uni had its own (the 
Pleasance Gym in Edinburgh, terrific place), with reasonable plans and fair 
prices for enrolled students.
I politely declined.
He was adamant and told me, we could just go and play a game of squash.
I yielded and we went to the gym together.
Of course he played me.
Sure, we went to the Pleasance to play squash, but to my surprise we arrived 
thirty minutes early.

"What should we do until our court is ready?" he asked.

"I don't know."

"Well, we could go down to the vaults and warm up."

"Alright." I answered innocently and followed like a lamb to the slaughter.

Of course we had to do squats. For warm-ups. Man. Squatting after three years 
with no weight training was nearly as bad as going running after an eight year
hiatus. 
The soreness I had to endure for over a week was excruciating.
One of the best parts of my daily routine was walking to and from uni through 
beautiful Edinburgh.
From Leith along Leith Walk to bustling Princes Street, crossing North Bridge 
with its breathtaking view over Old and New Town, Scott Monument and the 
Balmoral and finally alongside Old College through Potterrow Port to the Bayes 
Centre and back.
2.5 kilometers one-way.
For a week I hobbled the whole distance, but it was absolutely worth it.
I was hooked on weightlifting again.
The stress relief and your mind feeling light and fluffy from the release of 
all those colourful endorphins in the brain are just too good.
Combined with the reward of getting stronger, feeling healthier and a more 
attractive physical appearance, I was back on the grind and have been since 
that day I completely wracked my legs and lower back.
It has been almost exclusively weightlifting for me since then, with a few 
bodyweight exercises and the occasional squash match interspersed. 

Just a few weeks ago then, another friend&mdash;let's call him L, like that 
dude from Death Note&mdash;stayed over for a couple of weeks.
He's a decent amateur endurance athlete and asked me if I'd like to join him on 
one of his runs.
I politely declined.
He was adamant and told me, I'd feel great afterwards.
I yielded and we went running together.
If there is a morale to this tale then it is probably that you shouldn't be
spineless and give in to your silly friends so easily.
While spinelessness certainly plays a prominent role in my every-day decision
making, it was not the only reason I took him up on his offer.
I've been contemplating going running again for quite some time, because with 
just weightlifting I've been unable to address two of my most glaring weaknesses, 
namely an underdeveloped cardiovascular system and weak-ass flatfeet.
Both scream for moderate running with focus on proper forefoot striking 
\[[2](#ref-2),[4](#ref-4)\].
The most important condition to set me in the right mood for running though 
was the anxiety I was experiencing at that time.
Having a guest around, I wasn't paying enough attention to my personal 
well-being, not following my carefully laid-out self-care routines (which 
include regular exercising).
The excitement of being the host to a dear friend turned sour.
Whenever I'm in such an agitated and restless state of mind, my subconscious 
turns to escapism manifesting itself in a wish for self-castigation through, 
well, excessive bodily exercise.
It feels like an itch that must be scratched till the skin is all raw and 
tender. 
Or a demon that must be exorcised, if you so will.
Definitely a fine condition to be in before dusting off running shoes unused 
for nearly a decade.

The day I broke my eight year streak of no running finally arrived.
Throughout most of the day, I didn't know what was going to happen that late 
afternoon.
Though the pressure inside my brain has been high at the time, in the end
the decision felt quite spontaneous.
It was just L telling me that he'd go for a run now, asking me if I'd 
like to join him and I said yes, without a second thought.
I knew I couldn't keep up with him, so we decided to start out together and
split up.
I already had a route in mind.
I wanted to run to an outdoor gym I had seen when driving through a nearby
village.
My intention was to run there, do some pull ups, some dips and run back.
Turned out this outdoor gym I thought I had seen was not an outdoor gym at all 
but just the weirdest playground for children ever.
Not that I was in a condition to actually do an upper body workout when I 
arrived there, but still, what a disappointment.

After a couple of small starting problems (I took some time getting ready and 
had to turn around after a few meters&mdash;I had to leave my mobile behind, it
was too annoying to carry around with me), we were finally out on the road.
It was a fair day with the sun hanging fat and bright in a lazy blue sky.
A gentle breeze made the warm air quite pleasant on the skin.
We started out running down a hill with a smooth and easy decline, allowing us
to take in the gorgeous view.
The hill leads down to a calm and civilized plain stretching far and wide,
full of brown fields of rapeseed and wheat.
Behind the plain wild and wooded foothills rise abruptly, overshadowed by
the taller mountains farther away, kings and queens with their crowns of snow.
I was thoroughly enjoying myself and the beauty all around me, but not for long.
Once we reached the plain I was already starting to struggle, my condition 
deteriorating quicker than I had anticipated. 
I felt winded and my calves and feet were starting to act up, like they were
about to start cramping.

The weakest link was my stomach though.
Not knowing the day was about to get a lot more strenuous, I had a tremendous
and improper lunch.
We Germans love our bread and having a meal consisting of a few slices with 
a bunch of savory toppings to make open sandwiches and maybe a salad on the 
side is something quite common in Germany.
It is certainly the meal I consumed the most in my live and I deeply value 
the nourishment it provides to both body and soul.
Anyway, we had a nice and prolonged lunch with lots of thick slices of 
*Schwarzbrot*, topped with a thick layer of strong allioli, thick slices of 
fresh tomatoes and even thicker pieces of hearty cheese, made perfect with a 
drizzle of olive oil and arugula on top.
Some pickled olives and cucumbers and a small salad with a honey-mustard 
dressing on the side&mdash;it was pure and utter ecstasy.
Though lunch was amazing, it was not really the best choice of food to eat 
before taking my endurance to its limits and by the time we entered the plain,
I was feeling sicker with every step.

We finally caught sight of the crossroads where we would part.
A few trees and shrubs were giving valuable and scarce shade&mdash;in my 
unpreparedness, I had forgotten to put on sunscreen, of course&mdash;and I 
decided this would be a fine place to have my first rest.
L was already distancing himself from me, until about 200 meters separated us 
when he reached the crossroads.
To add insult to injury, he turned around and came back to me.
When we reached the crossroads together this time, I told him he can go and run 
his route and I'll run mine.
So he sprang off, taking a right.
I stayed behind in the shadow, bent over, gasping for air and absolution.
He ran around the corner, accelerating even more.
I retched.
He came prancing back, smiling at me and telling me he had taken the wrong way, 
he must take a right at the next crossing, not this one.
He took off to the left this time and disappeared around the other corner.
I retched again.
There I was, a foolish and miserable creature standing next to the crossroads, 
sick to its stomach, feet and lungs burning.
But at the same time alive and free, purged of the anxiety and restlessness 
that had plagued me the last few days.
I had what I wanted.
No thoughts. 
The most brutal way of being present.

I didn't know it at that time but I already managed to run two kilometers,
two thirds of the usual distance I'd run back in my basketball days.
In my arrogance I didn't bother to check the distance of the route to the 
playground and I badly miscalculated it.
Even with the self-destructive mindset and the overconfidence in my athletic 
abilities, I would've probably only aimed for five kilometers, a distance I've 
outrun maybe once or twice in my entire life&mdash;~~even when I was running
regularly, I never enjoyed it and I was never good at it.~~ (TODO: more 
prominent farther up)
I thought running to the playground and back again would cover that distance, 
more or less.
While waiting at the crossroads for the nausea to subside and for the devil to
show up and offer me the same deal as he did to the great Robert Johnson and 
that fool Faust, I was contemplating giving up and returning home.
Entertaining that thought for a minute, I disregarded it quickly and violently.
Not reaching that cursed playground was just not an option.
I retched a last time, stood up and trotted onwards.

By the time I continued, my feet and calves were cramping deliciously.
I managed to slowly stumble a few yards with forefoot striking but had to 
abandon it to relieve my aching muscles, switching to heel striking.
The switch of striking style allowed me to retain a rhythmic motion, though I 
knew it would be a temporary measure.
I don't want to demonize heel striking and I'm certainly not trying to give
anyone any advice (this story should make it pretty clear that I'm in no 
position to do that), but I know from past experience that heel striking is not
the right style for me, probably due to a mixture of improper form and 
structural reasons.
What is certain is that heel striking puts greater demand on the knees compared
to forefoot striking, which puts more demand on the Achilles tendon, ankle and 
foot muscles \[[3](#ref-3)\].
Given my history with chronic knee pain which developed during puberty&mdash;I
got diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatter disease when I was fourteen&mdash;I'm
quite vulnerable to it flaring back up when I put too much stress on my knees.

Running through brown and hot fields at a crawling pace, the only motivation I 
had left keeping me going was the wish to reach another shady spot.
I didn't want to add sunburn to my list of injuries.
It's not pain that will make you stronger and grants you relief.
It's pain that will give you skin cancer.
I made my way to another crossroad with a couple of Mediterranean cypress trees,
luring me with their precious shade and sweet scent.
Resting my aching body and soul beneath those ramrod straight and dusty soldiers 
not bowed by destiny or the memory of their ancient roots, my peace and 
lucidity was only disturbed by innocent passers-by, their eyes and smiles 
showing me their utter obliviousness to the magnitude of my heroic quest.
I had to continue my journey, rejuvenated by resignation and a desire to flee 
pending judgement, setting forth on the last section before I would reach that
God-forsaken playground.
The last section before reaching the halfway mark was more of the same, though 
the last few hundred meters I walked through a cool and shady forest, only 
pretending to run once I was out of the woods and faced with people again.
Vanity, definitely the devil's favourite sin.

Finally I reached my destination, though what I found was nothing like I 
imagined. 
To make the foolishness of the whole endeavour perfect, what had looked like an 
outdoor gym with bars and other fitness devices when I was driving by with my 
car turned out to be some sort of adventure playground for children from years 
eight to fourteen.
It wasn't like people older than fourteen were not allowed on that 
playground&mdash;I kinda gotten the idea that the playground was an outdoor gym
because I saw old people working out there&mdash;but more that the devices are
not suitable for taller folks.
What I had mistaken for a rack with an adjustable bar I could use to do pull-ups 
and dips on turned out to be fixed in place at about hip height.
Thoroughly enjoying the futility of what I had accomplished with my suffering,
I smiled and started my laborious way back.

On the return trip I was able to retain a steady stride suitable for my 
condition.
My knees were starting to get sore but still nothing compared to my burning 
feet and ankles.
I kept my pace easy and slow, stopping at the shady places I stopped before.
My brain was beautifully numb, shut down by the steady movement and exhaustion.
While I remember the disquiet during the first quarter of the run very well,
I can't recall the state of mind I was in while running back through the plane,
which makes me assume it was quite peaceful.
That is until I reached the last section, back up the hill.
With my poor endurance I was immediately winded once the not-so-steep incline 
began.
I was already running as slow as possible, so I couldn't decrease my speed any 
further if I didn't want to revert to walking.
Luckily there was a shady spot at the end of the section with the steepest 
incline I could use to pause and recharge before the last stupidity I would 
commit that day.

Only a small hump and a hundred meters of flat homestretch was standing between 
me and the sweet relief of home.
Cowering in the shade, staring down the last few meters of incline I had to
overcome, I went crazy.
It wasn't the first or the most intense bout of short-term craziness I
experienced due to fatigue and pain.
Once&mdash;in a similar state of mind&mdash;I decided it would be a proper 
blast to break-in new hiking boots with a fifty kilometer hike.
Turned my feet into a bloody pulp, but that's a story for another day.
I was able to witness an utterly irrational thought take roots in my mind,
conquer it and annihilate all reason I had left.
Completely filled with the conviction that the only way I'd manage the final 
stretch would be in a full-out sprint, that's what I did.
Conceptual understanding that this panting wreck of a body should not
be pushed to run as fast as it could still muster didn't matter.
What is reason worth if you can be alive instead?
To make my first run after eight years perfect in its foolishness, I sprinted. 
If you want call me wobbling and staggering slightly faster than before 
sprinting, that is.
Moaning and groaning like a rutting stag, wheezing and coughing like a chain 
smoker, spitting and screaming like a psycho I crossed the finish line.

How I felt afterwards nearly made up for the wreckage I caused myself.
My first runner's high.
Everything was soft and beautiful.
When I finally sat down an intense sense of calm washed over me, something I 
had missed for quite some time.
I was at peace, all was well.
Even the pain in my legs and lungs felt good.
A warm and tingly sensation arose underneath the cramps as my muscles started
to relax.
I was happy and couldn't stop smiling.
Not even my hurting ego, very much displeased with my performance, could subdue 
my state of exuberance.
