Last week I went running for the first time.
Well, not for the first time ever, but for the first time in a really long time.
A time span so long that it warrants a slightly more sensational title in my
humble opinion, though neither "Going Running for the First Time" nor "Going 
Running for the First Time in a Really Long Time" are particularly sensational 
and arousing; really, why the hell are you reading this? 
I think the last time I went for a run&mdash;it was so long ago that I can't
even remember exactly when&mdash;was around the time I had the written exams for 
my Abitur (German A-levels).
That was in April or May 2015, so pretty much exactly eight years ago.
Long enough for the bad memories to cease their hunting. 
Long enough to forget the suffering.
Long enough to get weary, let down my guard and fall prey to the sweetly
venomous words of ~~Lucifer~~ my obviously masochist friends.
Certainly time has corroded my defenses and opened the door for new painful 
memories to arise.
Which they did.
To properly process them I wrote this hopefully slightly entertaining story that 
does not contain an ounce of wisdom, advice or anything else valuable that you 
could apply to your own life.
I just can't help myself but to find human foolishness endlessly amusing.
Which is probably why God gave me so much of it.

You&mdash;probably a responsible adult with working instincts and the healthy 
ability to assess your own skills and abilities with accuracy&mdash;may be 
asking yourself right now: what is he talking about, running isn't so bad?
Running is not bad at all and it can be a very healthy and rewarding endeavour.
After all, our bodies are build to run.
But, as you might have guessed by now, I'm not a responsible adult with working
instincts and the healthy ability to assess my own skills and abilities with 
accuracy.
Like pretty much anything else out there, the act of putting one feet in front
of the other in an interval so rapid that there's a short period of time where 
neither foot touches the ground, can be abused and perverted in a way it becomes 
painful and destructive to the organism performing this particular motion.
You see, oftentimes I'm overestimating my abilities to a point beyond mere 
folly, no, the results tend to be in the land of utter and complete absurdity.
Combine this with the inability to be reasonable and give up when it becomes
clear that the set goals are not realistic, and you'll experience a good 
dosage of self-inflicted physical and mental pain.
This stubbornness leads to strange and unflattering moments where reality and 
the true extend of my abilities is revealed to me.
Luckily I'm weak as hell.
I don't need to run 200 miles in two days straight like Courtney Dauwalter to 
enter my pain cave, but just eight kilometers in about an hour, never far from 
home.

The second question that probably popped into your head: just eight kilometers, 
he must be in terrible shape then?
No, I'm not.
Before it all, I thought I was in peak physical condition.
I've been doing sports pretty much my whole life, with two notable absences. 
One year when I was 14 and three years from 2017 to 2020.
The former was due to a knee injury and the latter was caused by pure and utter 
laziness.
Before 2017 I was playing basketball in a club and all other athletic 
training&mdash;including running&mdash;was accessory to my goal of 
becoming a good basketball player. 
Then a few things happened in my life, one being the development of chronic 
pain in my knees, shins and feet due to my flat footedness and I just stopped 
playing basketball, a sport I have played since I remember.
I tried to do some exercises in the months that followed, but I never mustered 
enough motivation to find a regular training routine suitable to improve my 
weaknesses.
The next three years I did not exercise regularly, no weightlifting and for 
sure no running.
I lost some weight but otherwise stayed in decent enough shape and didn't
degenerate too badly.

In 2020 then, a friend&mdash;a decent amateur strength athlete&mdash;and 
I were discussing the fact that we were not using the offerings of our 
university enough.
He suggested to go to the gym together, as our uni had its own (the 
Pleasance Gym in Edinburgh, terrific place), with reasonable plans and fair 
prices for enrolled students.
I politely declined.
He was adamant and told me, we could just go and play a game of squash.
I yielded and we went to the gym together.
Of course he played me.
Sure, we went to the Pleasance to play squash, but to my surprise we arrived 
thirty minutes early.

"What should we do until our court is ready?" he asked.

"I don't know."

"Well, we could go down to the vaults and warm up."

"Alright." I answered innocently and followed like a lamb to the slaughter.

Of course we had to do squats. For warm-ups. Man. Squatting after three years 
with no weight training was nearly as bad as going for a run after eight years 
of no running.
The soreness I had to endure for over a week was excruciating.
One of the best parts of my daily routine was walking to and from uni through 
beautiful Edinburgh.
From Leith along Leith Walk to bustling Princes Street, over North Bridge with 
its breathtaking view over Old and New Town, Scott Monument and the Balmoral
and finally alongside Old College through Potterrow Port to the Bayes Centre 
and back.
2.5 kilometers one-way.
For a week I had to hobble the whole distance, but it was absolutely worth it.
I was hooked on weightlifting again.
The stress relief and your mind feeling light and fluffy from the release of 
all these colourful endorphins in the brain are just too good.
Combined with the reward of getting stronger, feeling healthier and a more 
attractive physical appearance, I was back on the grind and have been since 
that day I completely wracked my legs and lower back.
It has been almost exclusively weightlifting for me since then, with a few 
bodyweight exercises and the occasional squash match interspersed. 

Just a few weeks ago then, a friend&mdash;a decent amateur endurance athlete 
this time&mdash;stayed over for a couple of weeks.
He asked if I'd like to join him on one of his runs.
I politely declined.
He was adamant and told me, I'd feel great afterwards.
I yielded and we went running together.
If there is a morale to this tale then it is probably that you shouldn't be
spineless and give in to your friends so easily.
Okay spinelessness was not the only reason I took him up on his offer.
I've been contemplating going running again for quite some time, because with 
just weightlifting I've been unable to address two of my most glaring weaknesses, 
namely an underdeveloped cardiovascular system and weak-ass flatfeet.
Both scream for moderate running with focus on proper forefoot striking 
\[[1](#ref-1),[2](#ref-2)\].
It just took a little nudge and the right conditions to finally set my plans in 
motion.
The most important condition to set me in the right mood for running were high
levels of stress and anxiety I was experiencing at that time.
Having a guest around, I wasn't paying enough attention to my personal 
well-being, not following my carefully laid out self-care 
routines&mdash;including regular exercising&mdash;which lead to the excitement 
of being the host to a dear friend turn sour.
Whenever I'm in such a restless state of mind, my subconscious turns to 
escapism manifesting itself in masochistic fantasises of self-castigation 
through, well, excessive bodily exercise.
